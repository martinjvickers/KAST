## App test results 

For a simple `diff` based app test to check if we have had changes

Two directories `pairwise` and `search` for both types of operating mode.

### Search mode

Here is an example run of the pairwise result. Using `-k 3`, with `-q yeast.fasta` as a query and `-r seq1.fa` as a reference.

```
./kast -r example_data/seq1.fa -q example_data/yeast.fasta -k 3 -c 1 -t euclid -o results/search/euclid_k3
```
